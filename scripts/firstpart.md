# What's this UI? - Components

The `wtui-components` package is a Go library that offers a set of components for developing Text-based User Interfaces (TUI) with [wtui](https://github.com/anotherhadi/wtui) or in standalone mode.
It includes features like input fields, selections, and other essential components for building interactive text-based applications.
Easy to set up, use, customize and modify. Some components are inspired by [charmbracelet/bubbles](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles).

You can refer to the examples folder for each component to learn more about the component and/or opts.
